# Customer Engagement & Product Utilization Analytics for Retention Strategy

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer engagement and product utilization patterns to understand behavioral drivers of customer churn in a European banking dataset. Instead of relying only on demographic or financial metrics, the analysis focuses on engagement, product depth, and relationship strength to support retention strategy design.
